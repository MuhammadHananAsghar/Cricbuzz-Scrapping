       "  'article': \"That's all from us folks! Hope you enjoyed this cracking performance from Mumbai. Until next time then ...Here's what the players had to say -Rohit Sharma | MI Captain: Was a great win. We didn't start really well, but we always knew with the kind of attack Punjab had we wanted to capitalize. Those two guys they back themselves to get the runs, it's nice to have them in form as well. It wasn't going to be easy with the ball against KXIP batting line-up. We knew we had to get early wickets and everything went to plan, credit to the bowlers. The last game the execution wasn't exactly right at the death with the ball. So we discussed and wanted to improve. I haven't played enough with Boult and Pattinson, so it's difficult to get them on the same page. They have now got an idea of what I need from them and I got to know them better too.Kieron Pollard | Player of the Match: Feels good. We were on the losing side last game, so we want to come out on the right side today. It's about what's there in front of you. Look at the bowlers and see how many you want to get, 15 off the over and then you try to go hard. Today he had to come and swing and he showed his prowess. We know sky is the limit in the last 4 overs.Mayank Agarwal: We are not competing for the cap, we are just looking to play some good cricket. It doesn't matter who gets the runs, be it Rahul, Maxwell, Pooran or anyone else. Runs in the international circuit has given me a lot of confidence. In the lockdown, I sat down and looked on how things will work in the T20 template. The thought is just about getting into great positions.KL Rahul, KXIP captain: Obviously disappointing. Looking back, we could've been three wins out of four. This game, we made some mistakes. Important we come back stronger. Wicket looked good with the new ball. Don't know if it slowed up after that. Another bowling option would be nice - an all-rounder option who can bat and bowl well. Will be sitting with the coaches to decide if we want to play an extra bowler. Until and unless that orange cap stays with Kings XI I'm happy. He's (Agarwal) worked very hard and deserves that cap. I'm sure I'll take it off him soon.MI win by 48 runsRohit, Pollard and Hardik produced the goods with the bat while Chahar, Krunal, Bumrah and Pattinson dismantled KXIP without much fuss. Rahul and Mayank gave the side a brisk start but once Bumrah struck early, there was no stopping MI. Pooran did threaten for a bit but it wasn't enough to take the side close. All MI bowlers chipped in with wickets as the side bagged their second win.KXIP have now lost three games and this is their first bad game. It's been tough for them so far.Quick strikes - Neesham and Sarfaraz Khan fall in quick succession. The match is done and dusted. No miracles tonight.Five downMaxwell's scratchy innings comes to an end. Tried to slog against the spin against Chahar and gives a simple catch to deep midwicket.KXIP 109 for 5Four downMassive wicket for MI. The set batsman - Pooran - is caught behind. Full and wide, Pooran goes for the slog and gets a big edge.KXIP 101 for 4Big wicketRahul goes too far across to lap a Rahul Chahar delivery. He misses and the ball knocks the leg stump. A wicket just at the wrong time for KXIP. Pooran is looking good and he needed support from the other end.KXIP 60 for 3Two down ...Karun Nair falls now. Krunal gets the wicket as the batsman chops one back onto his stumps.KXIP 39 for 2Bumrah strikes ...Full and on the stumps and Mayank has no answers to it. Losses his stump and MI have the much-needed early wicket. KXIP had a brisk start and MI were getting desperate for a wicket.KXIP 38 for 1 in 5Brisk start - 33 for no loss in the first three overs ...Alrighty then, KL Rahul and Mayank to open for KXIP. Boult has the ball. Can KXIP chase this?Massive finish - MI 191 for 4Pollard 47 off 20     Hardik 30 off 11These two help MI finish big after scoring 67 off 23 in the end. 25 runs in the last over. 89 runs were scored in the last five overs and KXIP got their planning horribly wrong. Gowtham and Neesham bowled in the last five overs apart from Shami and leaked plenty.Rohit fallsShami comes back and strikes on the first ball. Miss-hit from Rohit towards long-off. Maxwell caught the ball but was going over. He lobbed the ball towards Neesham who had run in from long-on. KXIP needed this wicket. How many more can MI get?MI 124 for 4And Rohit kicks on ...1, 4, 4, 6, 6, 1 - From the MI captain against Neesham. 22 runs from the over. Plenty of trouble ahead for KXIP.MI 124 for 3 in 16Big overThe move to bowl Bishnoi hasn't worked for KL Rahul. Pollard hit a six and then Rohit pulled one as well over the fence. The MI captain also completed his half-century in the next over with a boundary against Neesham. Bishnoi ends the day without a wicket and 37 runs from his four overs.MI 107 for 3Three downMI are looking for a big finish and Kishan falls trying to force the pace. Floated outside off by Gowtham and slogged straight to deep midwicket. He falls for 28 off 32.MI 83 for 3Seven overs to go ...Rohit looks set and Ishan Kishan is in form. But the pitch is playing plenty of tricks and it isn't easy to score briskly. How many will Mumbai get?MI 83 for 2 in 13 oversIshan Kishan, coming into the game at the back of a 99 in the previous match, is struggling in the middle. He has failed to hit a boundary so far in his 20-ball stay, which has yielded only 13 runs for him.Rohit Sharma usually starts slow. But he started out with a boundary today. And since then, has hit some beautiful shots - off the front foot and the backfoot - for boundaries. As a result, despite a slow start and losing a couple of wickets, Mumbai Indians have managed 41 for 2 in the Powerplay.Suryakumar run out againFor the second game in a row, after some tentative Nos, Suryakumar Yadav pushes his captain for a quick single and ends up sacrificing his wicket. Rohit Sharma is pissed. 21/2 in 3.5 oversFirst strike ...No runs on the board and Mumbai have lost their first wicket. Swings away and de Kock tries to flick it. Misses the delivery and hears the death rattle. Cottrell bowls a wicket-maiden first up.Mumbai Indians 0 for 1Alrighty then, Rohit and de Kock will open. Sheldon Cottrell has the new ball. Excited?TOSS - KXIP opt to field and make one change. M Ashwin is out, K Gowtham is in.Mumbai Indians (Playing XI): Rohit Sharma(c), Quinton de Kock(w), Suryakumar Yadav, Ishan Kishan, Hardik Pandya, Kieron Pollard, Krunal Pandya, James Pattinson, Rahul Chahar, Trent Boult, Jasprit BumrahKings XI Punjab (Playing XI): Lokesh Rahul(w/c), Mayank Agarwal, Glenn Maxwell, Nicholas Pooran, Karun Nair, James Neesham, Sarfaraz Khan, Krishnappa Gowtham, Mohammed Shami, Sheldon Cottrell, Ravi BishnoiHello and welcome to the live blog of the IPL 2020 clash between Kings XI Punjab and Mumbai Indians.After heartbreaking losses, making it two defeats in three games for each of the sides, both Kings XI Punjab and defending champions Mumbai Indians are looking to find some momentum as they go head to head in Abu Dhabi on Thursday.While KXIP were at the receiving end of the spectacular heist that made Rahul Tewatia an overnight star, MI, despite an equally stunning fightback from Ishan Kisan and Kieron Pollard, could only so much as tie the game before succumbing in the Super Over against Royal Challengers Bangalore. However, the two teams have more in common than just heartache and mid-table placement. Two of the best bowling sides in powerplay this IPL, KXIP and MI are, at the same time, also the two worst faring sides in death overs. Their pacers' inconsistency - in particular that of Sheldon Cottrell and Jasprit Bumrah - has a lot to contribute to that.Hardik Pandya's first competitive tournament after a major surgery has meant that MI have been wary of using his bowling. And the lack of those four overs have greatly hurt the team balance as well. That their spinners haven't fired as yet only adds to their worries, especially going back to a venue where they might need to depend a lot more on their slower bowlers for control. And now they're up against a team led by KL Rahul, the man who has been leading from the front and boasts of a stellar record against them.Rahul's three previous scores against Mumbai Indians read 100* (64), 71* (57) and 94 (60), and his current form only makes him a bigger threat for Rohit & Co. In fact, Rahul (222) and teammate Mayank Agarwal (221) are the tournament's leading run-scorers at the moment, having scored marginally over 2/3rds of their team's runs in the three games so far. As much as Rahul will cherish the match-up against a seemingly off-colour Bumrah, MI would be hoping to exploit his weakness against spinners, his tendency to slow down in the middle overs. Which puts the spotlight on Pandya Sr. once more. Krunal's underwhelming returns, with both bat and ball, don't inspire much confidence. But the lack of a quality like-for-like replacement would mean there won't be too much tinkering with a line up that's seemed a bit rusty and is already one bowler short.\"},\n",

       "  'article': 'Chennai Super Kings head coach Stephen Fleming has said that the six-day break for his team came at the right time to help them get clarity on the way forward after making a groggy start to their IPL 2020 campaign.CSK started off on the opening night of the season with a win over holders Mumbai Indians in Abu Dhabi, but have been dealt with two successive defeats - by Rajasthan Royals in Sharjah and Delhi Capitals in Dubai.\"It [six-day break] came at a good time because the first three games were in quick succession and all games were at different grounds,\" Fleming told CSK website. \"So you have to appreciate trying to read conditions, for each game being predominantly the first team to play there was tough. And also coming off a couple of challenges we had off the field, we\\'ve used this break pretty well, we got some clarity around what we need to do and have practised very well.\"CSK have a busy October schedule, starting with Friday\\'s game against SRH. The games come thick and fast for the three-time champions, but of the next five matches, four of them are at the same venue. For a side that has played each of their first three matches at different grounds, it comes as a welcome change. Though they came up second-best against Delhi Capitals in Dubai, Fleming reckons playing in the same venue for an extended period of time should hold his side in good stead.\"It\\'s very helpful that we can settle in and try and read conditions at one ground and not several. I\\'m looking forward to putting in a bit of performance than we did the last time we played at Dubai where we were outplayed by Delhi Capitals. There were a number of areas that we weren\\'t happy with, and we\\'ve worked hard on those.\"CSK will also welcome the return of Ambati Rayudu to full fitness, while Fleming has said that Dwayne Bravo is available for selection too.'},\n",

       "  'article': 'There is a possibility that Ellyse Perry, Australia\\'s star allrounder, might feature only as a batter for Sydney Sixers in the upcoming Women\\'s Big Bash League considering her injury concerns. But Australia head coach Matthew Mott said that it would only be for the short term, insisting that her all-round role is \"instrumental\" for the national team\\'s success.Perry, who suffered a tear to her right hamstring during the T20 World Cup earlier this year, underwent a surgery and has been on the road to recovery since. She recently suffered another injury to her hamstring while training - the latest injury was to a different part of her right hamstring - which ruled her out of the remainder of the series against New Zealand, while her availability for the start of the Women\\'s Big Bash League is also in doubt.\"She could easily hold a spot as a batter alone, but as an allrounder she\\'s absolutely instrumental in a lot of success we\\'ve had,\" Mott said. \"She\\'s worked incredibly hard in that break. Realistically she was always going to struggle to be available for that (T20I) series, given how dramatic that injury was, (but) she\\'ll do everything she can to come back as an allrounder.\"I think in the short term we\\'re talking about the possibility of that role coming back a little bit in the Big Bash. Ben Sawyer, who\\'s her Sixers coach, we had the benefit of having him up (in Brisbane), so we talked about that in the short term. But definitely in the long term, she\\'s determined she wants to bowl fast and she\\'s doing everything she can in her training to get back to that level.\"With Perry turning 30 next month, and with a fair share of injury problems of late, bowling could take a back seat as has been the case with many allrounders in cricket. But Mott stressed that Perry is \\'determined\\' to continue as a genuine allrounder, and with good management she would be able to do so for a long period.\"It\\'s something we talk about a lot. As allrounders do get into the back of their careers, the bowling can often drop off, but I can assure you Ellyse is very determined to come back as a genuine allrounder. That\\'s the balance I guess. We\\'ll be smart with all that. Her management plan is going to be very detailed and we\\'ve already spoken about what that looks like. When you take Ellyse Perry out of our team you realise just how great she is, because you have to replace her with two players usually.\"We\\'ve got some really exciting allrounders but Ellyse could hold her spot as a bowler or a batter in the team, and that for me is the definition of a genuine allrounder. They don\\'t come along too often, we\\'re blessed to have her and I desperately hope we can get her back as a genuine allrounder in the future,\" added Mott.'},\n",

       "  'article': 'In the Central conference, the weekend was once again lit up by a scintillating knock of 80 by Irving\\'s Rayyan Pathan. Equal to the task was former Pakistan batsman Rameez Raja Jr whose knock of 82 helped Houston to take the game to the Super Over, which they eventually won.Up north in Chicago, Shaheer Hassan took the Michigan Stars bowlers to the cleaners with a tantalizing 101* off 50 balls. To keep him company in their 10-wicket victory was his longtime friend and business partner, USA international Fahad Babar.\"We call him Chris Lynn,\" said Fahad about Shaheer to Cricbuzz. \"It was such a joy watching him bat the way he did. We bat day in and day out with each other. We quickly assessed the pitch and ground conditions and got along with it. We both are completely different kind of batsmen and score in different areas. When on song it gets difficult for the other team to counter us,\" added Fahad.Not quite there with \"Lynnsanity\"as yet on the bigger stage, Shaheer has built himself a reputation notching up big scores in T20 cricket. A freak when toying with club bowlers in Chicago, +he has also shown his mettle where it has mattered, having scored a 77 off 39 balls against an attack consisting of Rusty Theron, Rayad Emrit and Roelof Van der Merwe, among many.\"Believe it or not I acquired a lot of my power hitting skills through tape ball cricket. I didn\\'t know I could be this destructive with the bat. I kind of rue not taking it up seriously till 23. But I am trying to compensate for that now. I have my own Bola bowling machine that I use for my power hitting training almost every day,\" said Shaheer to Cricbuzz.Interestingly, after moving to the US at 18, Shaheer hardly played any club cricket until his college graduation at 23. Now 28, Shaheed is in the periphery of USA selection having attended two national camps in the past two years.Although overshadowed by Shaheer\\'s hundred, Fahad himself had a good game, finishing with an unbeaten 65 including 5 sixes.A batting mainstay for USA from his debut in 2014 until 2017, Fahad is still looking for reasons for his ouster. \"There was no formal communication on why I was dropped or what was wrong with my game. It was a difficult pill to swallow,\" said Fahad. It is believed that apart from the emergence of Monank Patel at the top of the order, Fahad\\'s inability to consistently score at a fair clip was instrumental in him facing the axe from the national team.Although dejected, Fahad took the opportunity to fine-tune nuances in his game. He spent time playing departmental cricket in his native Pakistan and even managed to secure a spot at the Peshawar Zalmi training camp.\"I got to work with a lot of world class players at Zalmi. I made the most out of my opportunity. Younis Khan helped me work on my T20 game. Thanks to him, I now employ the trigger movement with a still head. That has helped me open up new avenues of run scoring that were absent in my game previously,\" adds Fahad.In the western conference, 17 year old Sanjay Krishnamurthi impressed again with a strokeful 42 off 23 balls, averaging 97 over 5 innings having been dismissed only once. This is the second innings of note from the teenager within two weeks after steering his team home from 21 for 5 on a treacherous pitch with an unbeaten 37.Born in Arizona in 2003, Sanjay got starstruck with cricket while watching the 2011 World Cup with his dad. Within 3 months\\' time, the family decided to move to their native Bangalore with Sanjay\\'s cricket being one of the many driving factors.\"Fortunately, I was able to spend a lot of time with him after our move over there and focus on cricket. We built cricket nets with a bowling machine for Sanjay in our backyard,\" says Satya Krishnamurthi, Sanjay\\'s father.Starting out as a left arm orthodox spinner, he was the youngest among final 20 hopefuls at Spin Stars, a talent hunt contest launched by Anil Kumble. Sanjay started making serious strides towards his cricket when he scored over 500 runs in 6 games in the highly competitive Bangalore schools\\' cricket. That eventually led to his selection in the Karnataka State Cricket Association U-16 squad, one of the toughest age group state sides to break into in India.Sanjay arrived in Houston earlier this year to attend a training camp hosted by USA Cricket. The lockdown and the prospects of the arrival of professional cricket in the US led to one decision after the other for the Krishnamurthy family. Only leaving Bangalore with 3 suitcases with the hope of returning back, the family has once again settled in the Bay area now for good, with Sanjay\\'s cricketing future with USA taking primacy.\"I didn\\'t know much about cricket in the USA before my friend Raj Vyas took a 7-wicket haul in one of the U-19 World Cup qualifying games and I saw that on social media. That 2022 U-19 World Cup is something I am gearing towards. I want to do well and test myself out against the best,\" said Sanjay to Cricbuzz.Come the 2022 U-19 World Cup qualifiers, not only will Sanjay be one of the first names on the team sheet, he will also form the bulwark of USA\\'s batting.'},\n",

       "  'article': 'The 2008 champions, Rajasthan Royals, who were the only unbeaten team of the 2020 Indian Premier League, suffered their first loss at the hands of Kolkata Knight Riders in Dubai on Wednesday (September 30). Rajasthan\\'s first two wins had come in Sharjah on the back of two good batting performances. Playing their first match of the season at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, barring Tom Curran\\'s late blitz, none of the Royals\\' batsmen made an impression, as they ended up losing the game by a margin of 37 runs.In fact, only one of their top-five batsmen - Jos Buttler - got into double-digits. Robin Uthappa, one of Royals\\' middle-order batsmen, played down the claims of ground dimensions as the reason behind their loss and remarked that the 22-yard strip \\'changed a bit\\' during the second innings.\"We have played practice matches on bigger grounds as well,\" Uthappa said in a press conference. \"So, it\\'s just a matter of adjusting to the pace of the wicket. As we play more games here, we\\'ll get better at it. Today, we\\'ve got a good sense of how this wicket\\'s gonna play. It\\'s pretty similar to our practice wickets. We are looking forward to the next games as well. Our performance will only climb from hereon.\"In hindsight, we could have taken a little more time. We got the sense that the wicket changed a little bit. Post the first innings, I thought that the wicket began stopping a little bit. Obviously, it was a used wicket. I think towards the end, the wicket started getting a little tired. In hindsight, we felt, we could have taken a little bit of time to get adjusted. And then take the attack to the bowlers,\" he added.Coming off an incredible run-chase, where they hunted down Kings XI Punjab\\'s 223 with three balls to spare, the Royals decided to chase again despite the fact that all matches in Dubai this season so far have been won by teams batting first. Even an in-form Rajasthan couldn\\'t reverse that trend.\"We chased a big score in the last game. Obviously, there is a lot of confidence coming in from that. We felt that the wicket would play well,\" replied Uthappa when he was asked why the Royals opted to field first.Rajasthan Royals, chasing 175, lost most of their wickets playing risky shots. However Uthappa wasn\\'t critical of his batsmen. \"We play a certain brand of cricket and today we continued to play that as a batting line-up. Obviously, there have been learnings from this game and those learnings will be taken into our stride and applied in the games to come.\"'},\n",

       "  'article': \"After winning the first four matches of the five-match series batting first, the hosts decided to bowl first as the game was reduced to five overs per side contest due to rain. After restricting their opponents to a relatively modest total, England scraped home in the final over to complete the 5-0 clean-sweep on Wednesday (September 30) at the County Ground in Derby.The Caribbean women, being inserted to bat, scored 11 runs off the opening over, with Deandra Dottin hitting a four and six off successive balls off Freya Davies. The latter managed to snuff out Hayley Matthews off her final ball of the over. England choked the West Indies batters further as Katherine Brunt and Sophie Ecclestone picked a wicket each and conceded just three and six runs off their respective first over. Stafanie Taylor's back-to-back boundaries and Natasha McLean's maximum off the last ball of the innings ensured that the West Indies bowlers had something to defend.Chasing 42, the home team changed their batting order, however that move didn't work as Shamilia Connell dismissed skipper Heather Knight and the in-form Amy Ellen Jones (who came in at 3) in the very first over. Tammy Beaumont came out with a positive intent scoring back-to-back boundaries off Shakera Selman, but the latter had the last laugh as she deceived the English batter with a slower delivery.The asking rate was constantly around 7 or 8, but England kept losing wickets. The Windies inflicted a run-out and Taylor pulled off a stunner at cover off successive balls to reduce the hosts to 25 for 5 in the third over. England needed seven runs off the final over and the first three balls progressed as follows: 2, 1 (run-out), 1 (run-out). The equation for the home team came down to three needed off three deliveries with three wickets in hand. In an anticlimactic end, Selman bowled two no-balls - overstepping one and bowling another one above the waist - and gifted the match away to England. None of the England batters got into double-digits, but that didn't stop them from winning the first-ever five overs per side women's T20I contest.Brief Scores: West Indies Women 41 for 3 in 5 overs (Stafanie Taylor 15*, Natasha McLean 14*; Freya Davies 1-11) lost to England Women 42 for 7 in 4.3 overs (Tammy Beaumont 9; Shamilia Connell 3-14) by 3 wickets\"},\n",

       "  'article': 'Up against a destructive Rajasthan Royals\\' top order comprising of Steven Smith, Jos Buttler and Sanju Samson, Mavi kept his calm when he was brought into the attack in just the third over of the game with Rajasthan chasing 175. Cummins had already gained a one-up on Smith, who tried to slog from the first ball he faced. It was very unlike Smith, but with five superb deliveries with near-misses, he fell on the final one of the second over that handed KKR an early advantage. They smelt blood and they didn\\'t relent thereafter.Mavi was mentally prepared for a flatter wicket, but when he saw the wicket seaming a little bit early on, he bowled on a length with good pace, tossing in the shorter ones to mix it up and stuck to the plan. He was rewarded soon enough, more so for the lack of adaptability from RR\\'s batsmen on a wicket that was stopping a little bit, who were still perhaps recovering from their Sharjah hangover.Cummins at the other end, bowled through the powerplay with his Test-match line and lengths, as he did against Sunrisers Hyderabad, as KKR stuck to a working plan. Although RR\\'s batsmen tried to throw him off his lengths by attempting to launch an attack, Buttler even using his pace to dispatch a ramp for six, it was all they could get with Cummins conceding only 13 in three overs. Mavi and Cummins bowled five of the first six overs for 2-24.Buttler was still in the middle and was finding his feet; he was key if RR had to make a chase out of it. Plan or not, Mavi tossed up a shorter one that Buttler would\\'ve got hold of more often than not, but it went straight to third man as KKR were in the driver\\'s seat without breaking a sweat; in three overs, Mavi had 2-13 with game-changing wickets in his pocket.Pace was persisted through with Nagarkoti replacing Cummins. He bowled a short one to start but incredibly Robin Uthappa\\'s pull landed straight in the hand of deep backward square leg. He struck first ball for his maiden IPL wicket and then picked up Riyan Parag in the same over, as the match was half-won for KKR within ten overs - nine of which were from pacers on a wicket that was touted to have some purchase for the spinners.\"I think just having a player like Cummins around is a confidence booster,\" Dinesh Karthik said after KKR\\'s 37-run win. \"He\\'s just so good with the young kids, and he\\'s great to have around the team too...just the way he smiles, his body language, he\\'s just such a pleasure to have around. I wish all fast bowlers all around the world (have such help), Cummins is an extraordinary role model. Not only on the field, but even off it, he\\'s wonderful to have around.\"The boys are learning a lot from him. The fact that he\\'s interacting with all these boys not only on the field, but making a genuine effort off the field as well makes a massive difference and in my eyes he\\'s just going up the ladder in the way he\\'s behaving and the way he\\'s with the young boys.\"A world-class pacer like Pat Cummins taking Mavi and Nagarkoti under his wing was bound to have done wonders for them ©BCCIKKR would\\'ve taken a leaf out of the Rajasthan innings, watching Jofra Archer operate upfront. Not having had opened the bowling in Sharjah against Punjab, he bowled just the one over to kick things off, playing to his strengths by cranking up the pace. He bowled close to the 150 mark consistently in the opening over but was kept for the Andre Russell face-off.He was brought back when RR needed a wicket with Shubman Gill going great guns. With a length delivery of 140 kmph that angled into the opener, he took a return catch to give his side the breakthrough. He rattled Russell, Karthik and Morgan too with short balls. After getting KKR\\'s skipper Karthik, he could\\'ve had his England skipper too had Tom Curran held on to one in the deep. The fastest he bowled on the day was 152, giving away just four in his first three overs, finishing with 2-18 in one of the finest T20 spells.Rajasthan and Kolkata were playing their first game in Dubai; it was always going to come down to the team that adapted to the conditions better that would take honours - as KKR did, sticking to their plans and executing them right. They took all the chances that came their way and banked on their vast bowling resources to get them over the line. In the end, it came down to the first ten overs that were dominated by the pacers that made the difference.Acquired by KKR in 2018, injuries never gave Mavi or Nagarkoti much opportunity to validate the franchise\\'s belief in them. On Wednesday (September 30), the pair was handed the responsibility to get RR\\'s top order early. And they delivered. The pace they were hitting, their attacking mindset, and the four wickets they shared, will give them a lot of confidence going ahead.\"Just to see both these boys playing for us, representing our franchise...the fact that we\\'ve stuck with them...just to see them out there makes me happy. They\\'re bowling well, fielding well. I\\'ve been wanting to see them since the time they played the World Cup,\" said Karthik.Before KKR could take the field in the second innings, Cummins was at the helm of the pep talk. Whatever he said to the side seemed to work wonders, with him leading from the front once again - a reflection of his role in a KKR set-up that possesses quite a few future stars.'},\n",

       "  'article': \"Kolkata Knight Riders handed Rajasthan Royals their first loss in IPL 2020 as Steve Smith's men fell short by 37 in chase of 174. Shubman Gill and Eoin Morgan helped the Knight Riders build a strong total before Pat Cummins and Shivam Mavi landed blows after blows to leave Royals in a hole.Pace like fire ...Even before KKR got going, Jofra Archer bowled absolute bullets at Gill and Sunil Narine in the first over. In the opening over, he bowled three deliveries over 150 kph and the lowest speed he hit was 147 kph. In his first three overs, he had figures of 3-0-4-2 but Morgan and Cummins hit a six and a four in Archer's last over to spoil his figures a bit. Despite leaking 14 in his final over, he ended with 4-0-18-2 to keep KKR to a par score.So how did KKR get 174?Gill continued to impress and even with Narine struggling from the other end, there were no unnecessary risks from the right-hander. Narine made 15 off 14 as the opening partnership fetched the team 36. KKR were well placed after ten overs with 82 on the board with two wickets down. Gill had moved to 47 off 34 but fell to Archer.Andre Russell had more than ten overs to face and showed plenty of promise. He hit three mighty sixes to race to 24 off 13 but fell trying to go for more. KKR were in a tricky situation but Morgan steadied things a bit and took it deep. KKR were 127 for 5 after 16 overs and then hit 47 in the last four overs. Morgan went from 6 off 10 to end with 34 off 23 to give the bowlers a fighting chance.What went wrong for RR then?Sharjah hangover?The RR top-order seemed in a hurry. Steven Smith looked ungainly and played ugly swipes on five of the seven deliveries he faced. Sanju Samson looked sublime during his nine-ball stay but three his wicket away trying to pull Mavi. Buttler decided against taking the conservative approach and fell trying to chase a wide one from Mavi. At 39 for 3 in 6.1 overs, RR middle-order was under too much pressure.Robin Uthappa and Riyan Parag crumbled under pressure while Rahul Tewatia trying and failed to repeat his Sharjah heroics. RR were 67 for 6 after 11 overs and already out of the contest by then.Was there a standout performer?Two actually. Cummins and Mavi. If Archer was on fire, Cummins was absolutely sublime. Smith tried to put the Australia pacer under pressure and tried to hit him off his length. Cummins, however, stuck to his Test match lengths, continued to ask questions and created three opportunities. On the third, Smith eventually inside-edged the delivery and was caught behind.Mavi was put under pressure by Buttler but continued to impress with his skills. He was a touch lucky with the dismissal of Buttler was took out Samson to leave RR gasping.Should RR have batted first?Probably. All six games in Dubai so far have been won by the side batting first. RR probably were guilty of taking the conservative approach and hoping for dew to settle in in the second innings. The RR top-order was dismantled way too quickly during the chase for the dew to give any scares to KKR on the night.Where next then?RR will play Royal Challengers Bangalore in Abu Dhabi on October 3 in the first afternoon encounter of the tournament. KKR will play the second game that day - against Delhi Capitals - in Sharjah.Brief scores: Kolkata Knight Riders 174/6 in 20 overs (Shubman Gill 47, Eoin Morgan 34*; Jofra Archer 2-18) beat Rajasthan Royals 137/9 in 20 overs (Kamlesh Nagarkoti 2-13, Shivam Mavi 2-20) by 37 runs.\"}]"
